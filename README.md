## Architecture
1. User uploads image/video via mobile app  
2. Data is sent to the server with AI model  
3. Model analyzes and returns:  
   - Adhesion status (Red/Green)  
   - Accuracy percentage  
   - Graph visualization  
4. Results are stored in Firebase for patient history  
5. Doctors can review saved reports  
6. Web app provides project info and APK download

## Impact & Use Cases
- Speeds up adhesion detection for doctors  
- Reduces diagnosis time & medical errors  
- Accessible AI healthcare for everyone  

**Use Cases:**  
- Post-surgery adhesion monitoring  
- Hospital & clinic scalable diagnostics  
- Remote healthcare applications  

**Future Scope:**  
- Extend to detect other medical imaging conditions (tumors, fractures)  
- Integration with hospital management systems  
- Build a full SaaS product for healthcare AI
